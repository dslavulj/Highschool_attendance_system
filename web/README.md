Login page
Â 
The login page has a form that requires the user to enter username and password.
The layout is very simple. One box in the middle of the page containing the "Login" heading. Below that is a username and password fields.
At the bottom of that box is a login button.
If the username is not in the database, or the password is incorrect, the user will not successfully login, and will receive a specific error.
If the information is correct, the system recognizes whether it is a student or a teacher and sends it to the main page.
