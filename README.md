# Highschool attendance system

Student attendance monitoring system using NODEMCU (ESP8266), RFID key, and RFID-RC522 module.
The device sends the classroom number and UID key to the server using the MQTT protocol, server checks received data in the database and registers its arrival in the database.
The website is for students to view attendance and professors to review and modify them as needed.

The project was made for TVZ MC2 2019.
